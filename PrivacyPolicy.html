                WE DON’T SHARE YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION<br><br>
                This policy was last updated on March 1st, 2020.<br><br>

                Stay USA Hotel & Suites respects the privacy of 
                all our guests, and we are committed to protecting it. 
                This policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose 
                information about our guests.<br><br>

                INFORMATION COLLECTED<br><br>

                We collect information that can identify you personally, 
                such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email 
                address, credit card information, etc. (“personal data”) only
                when it is voluntarily provided to us by you or by a third party 
                (such as a travel agency) on your behalf. We collect personal data 
                when it is provided through forms on our websites, mobile applications, 
                over the phone, through physical mail or e-mail, or in-person.<br><br>

                This website does not collect, save or store any personal data from you while 
                you simply browse this website, unless you voluntarily and intentionally provide 
                it to us (for example, by making an online booking or requesting further information).<br><br>

                Our servers automatically collect certain technical, non-personal information when 
                you use our websites or mobile applications (“usage data”). Technical data 
                may include your browser type, operating system, page views and clicks, 
                IP address, unique device ID, and referral URLs.<br><br>

                USE OF INFORMATION<br><br>

                We use your personal data to fulfill the purpose for which it was 
                provided, or as otherwise set forth in this policy. For 
                example, we may use your personal data as necessary to:<br><br>

                process your reservation request and payment;
                enroll you in Stay USA Hotel & Suites loyalty program
                contact you about your reservation;
                make requested changes to your reservation or user account;
                provide you with a personalized experience on our websites;
                respond to your inquiries and other communications;
                register you to receive newsletters or other information for which you’ve expressed an interest; and
                to comply with legal requirements.<br><br>
                You may opt out of receiving any promotional or marketing emails at any 
                time by contacting us directly or by following the “opt out” or “unsubscribe” 
                links in such emails. We may, however, continue to contact you with relevant 
                information about your past or upcoming reservations with us.<br><br>

                We may use the usage data we collect for any reason we deem 
                appropriate, including to improve, maintain, and operate our websites and services.<br><br>

                SHARING OF INFORMATION<br><br>

                We will not sell any of your personal data to any outside organization. 
                We only disclose your personal data to third parties as reasonably necessary 
                to carry out the permitted uses described in the “USE OF INFORMATION” section of 
                this policy. For example, we may share personal data with:<br><br>

                our payment processors, technical and customer support contractors, and other service 
                providers who are required to keep the personal data confidential and are prohibited from 
                using it other than to carry out their services on our behalf;
                our successors in the event of a sale, merger, acquisition, or similar 
                transaction affecting the relevant portion of our business; and
                legal and governmental authorities or other third parties, 
                to the extent required to comply with a legal order or applicable law.<br><br>

                SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA<br><br>

                Stay USA Hotel & Suites is committed to the security of your 
                personal data. We use commercially reasonable technical measures 
                to protect personal data in our possession, and our website uses secure 
                socket layer (SSL) encryption technology to help protect the privacy of 
                credit card information, name, address, email and other sensitive information you provide to us.<br><br>

                COOKIES AND PROFILES<br><br>

                Stay USA Hotel & Suites and our third party marketing partners may use 
                cookies, invisible pixels, local shared objects (i.e., persistent cookies) 
                and web beacons to obtain information about visitors of our websites and mobile 
                applications. Cookies are small text files that are placed on a computer or 
                mobile device when you visit a website or use an app. We use cookies 
                on our websites and apps to personalize content presented to you, 
                retain information such as dates and room selection as you proceed 
                through the reservation process, allow you to sign in more easily, and track responses to our ads.<br><br>

                You can set your computer to warn you each time a cookie is 
                sent or turn off all cookies (except Flash cookies) through your 
                browser. Check your browser’s Help menu or your built-in mobile device 
                settings to find out how. Some mobile devices store cookies not 
                only in areas connected to the browser, but also in areas 
                that are app-specific, which cannot be controlled 
                by the browser settings. Check your app settings options 
                on your mobile device to find out how to manage or delete cookies 
                that may be stored in these other areas. If you do not accept cookies, 
                some features, services or activities that are available on our websites or 
                mobile apps may be adversely affected and you may be unable to perform certain 
                transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content. The choice 
                to accept or deny a cookie is different from your choice to accept/deny email messages.<br><br>

                We also serve ads through third-party advertising technology. In the course of serving 
                our advertisements to you, unique third-party persistent cookies, clear gifs or beacon 
                gifs may be placed on your computer or device to help manage our online advertising, 
                recognize when a device visits our websites, learn which ads bring users to our websites, 
                and track whether a reservation is made. The information our ad-serving providers and we 
                collect through this technology is not personally identifiable but is used to create an 
                anonymous profile which allows the ad-serving provider to serve ads targeted towards you 
                and your interests across the ad-serving network. Our third party marketing partners may 
                then pool the anonymous information that they collect from our websites and mobile applications 
                with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of sending you direct mail or a catalog.<br><br>

                Our websites do not currently respond to “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by your device or browser.<br><br>

                LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES<br><br>

                Please be aware that third-party websites available 
                through links on our websites each have separate privacy 
                and data collection practices. We have no control, responsibility 
                or liability for these third-party websites or their applicable 
                policies or content. Stay USA Hotel & Suites cannot ensure or warrant 
                the security of any information you disclose on third-party sites.<br><br>

                Data Controller: We are typically the data controller, as that term is used in applicable European privacy 
                laws, for any personal data that we collect from you. However, when we collect personal data about you from 
                a third party (e.g., travel agencies), the third party may be the data collector for such data and we may be 
                the data processor. If we are acting as the data processor, we will only process the relevant personal data 
                as requested by the data controller.<br><br>

                Retention: We may retain your personal data so long as we can reasonably foresee the data may be required in 
                connection with our relationship with you (for example, to address inquiries regarding past or future reservations, 
                or so long as you maintain a user account with us), or as required by law.<br><br>

                Access, Correction, Deletion: You may access and correct your personal data that we process, except where the burden
                of providing you such access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of other 
                persons would be violated. You may also request erasure of your personal data in certain circumstances. To request
                access to, correction of, or erasure of your personal data, please contact us as set forth at the end of this privacy 
                policy. In cases where we are not the data controller (such as when the personal data was collected from or on behalf 
                of an air travel provider or other customer), we may need to refer you or your request to the applicable data controller instead.<br><br>

                CHILDREN’S POLICY<br><br>

                Our websites and services are not intended for children and we do not knowingly solicit or collect personal data from children. If we are notified or discover that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal data to us, we will take reasonable steps to delete the information.<br><br>

                CHANGES TO THIS POLICY<br><br>

                We may update this policy from time to time. We will always post the then-current version of this policy on our websites, and will indicate at the top of the policy the date on which the latest version took effect. Please review this policy from time to time to stay updated on our privacy practices.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
